# Responsible disclosure policy

## Introduction

We take security very seriously at SDA SE.
We welcome any review of the latest release of all our open source code to ensure that these
components can not be compromised.
In case you identified a security related issue with severity of _low_ to _medium_, please create
a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SDA-SE/mongodb-operator/issues).


## Security related bugs with severity _high_ or _critical_

In case you identified a security related issue with severity of _high_ or _critical_, please
disclose information about the issue non-public via email to `opensource-security@sda.se`.

We encourage researchers to include a Proof-of-Concept, supported by screenshots or videos.
For each given security related issue with severity _high_ or _critical_ (based on SDA SE own
assessment), we will respond within one week.


# Known security gaps and future enhancements

There is no format in commits to identify security related fixes.
It is not planned yet.

We perform daily vulnerability scans to be informed about known vulnerabilities.
We perform a vulnerability assessment as soon as possible and perform actions based on the outcome.
