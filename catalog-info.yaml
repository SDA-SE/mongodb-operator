    # MongoDB Operator
  
    A Kubernetes Operator that creates users and databases in existing MongoDB clusters based on a
    custom resource.
  
    Based on the resource name, a secret is created that contains the dynamically generated database
    name, username and password.
  
    When the operator is installed in a cluster, a database can be requested with a MongoDB resource
    as shown on the usage page
  
    The MongoDB Operator is tested with MongoDB and DocumentDB.

  title: MongoDB Operator CRD
  description: |
    CRD to request a MongoDB database from the mongodb-operator.
    
    A MongoDB custom resource initiates a request for a database for the namespace where it is located.
    A database user with access to a database named `[metadata.namespace]_[metadata.name]`
    will be created by the MongoDB Controller in an already existing MongoDB instance.
    A secret containing username and a random password with the same `metadata.name` as this
    custom resource will be provided in the same namespace.
  
    Currently the database host, port, options and other parameters than username and
    password must be set according the MongoDB instance configured for the cluster in the
    MongoDB Controller.
    The secret and the user will be removed, when this custom resource is deleted.
  
    The database will be deleted if `spec.database.pruneAfterDelete` is `true`.
